      "Great place to stroll around, lots of street in the this, cheaper food and lots of sales. best in evening.\n",
      "This place was so great, I visited on 3 separate occasions during my stay. Shopping was excellent, the people were friendly and nice, the lights bright and food delicious. You have not properly visited South Korea without a stop at Myeong Dong. P.S.The egg pastry bites are amazing!!!! I couldn’t stop eating them.\n",
      "This is great to see at night when eveyrhing is lit up . a place to find some good shopping are get a nice meal. Add this along the way to Seoul Tower. There is a heretage village nearby . The South Gate is also near. The Catholic Cathedral is near and worth a visit\n",
      "Me encanto para ir de compras encuentras lo que quieras desde comida callejera hasta cafes donde puedes acariciar gatitos tiendas por dond vayas el metro esta cerca, encontraras lo que necesites ya sea en la calle o en centros comerciales en este lugar, muy buen maquillaje coreano por todos lados\n",
      "you should not miss out on the Street food and variety shopping in Myeongdong. that is where you can find the famous flavoured nuts such as almonds and cashew nuts. try it!!\n",
      "Myeong Dong is a commercial south of the City Hall and near the Seoul City Train Station. It is also in walking distance to Seoul Tower. The area does have predestrian streets so you can rome freely. The area has many small shops and is good for souvenir hunting. There are some restaurants inthe area including some western style one . A bit crowded at times so pick when you go here carefully.\n",
      "This is the shooting site of RUNNING MAN. I live in TMARK HOTEL near Mingdong, near a subway station, so it's very convenient. There are many shopping malls and cosmetics shops in Mingdong, basically the needs of shopping can be met. As soon as 4 or 5 p.m., vendors came out to set up stalls one after another, and those who had food and those who sold small things. Selling scarves, socks and bags is more expensive than other areas. After all, it is a tourist area, but they are not used to bargaining. Many of the cosmetics sold here are packaged to sell, or bind to sell, more weight, want to buy less can go to Hongda there. As a fashion editor, I like to combine tourism with fashion best. Travel to many countries, slowly complement the strategy, can be interested in attention, there are a lot of thoughts to share with you _____________\n",
      "i feel like heaven in thiz place because of the make up which is everywhere i cant believe that this street is only for fashion and mostly make up i really love this place\n",
      "Myeongdong is a lively place to visit for the urban and hippy shoppers. You can shop for beauty products and snacks and designer clothes. What I love is the street foods area. Enjoy variety of authentic Korean street foods at reasonable prices.\n",
      "it’s a shopping area. lots of restaurants and skin care shops, and night food market with lots of street foods\n",
      "Great place to stroll around, lots of street in the this, cheaper food and lots of sales. best in evening.\n",
      "Myeongdong is Korea's best-known shopping district. It is regarded as Taipei's Ximending or Japan's Shibuya Crossing. Shoppers can enjoy shopping for local and international brands of cosmetics, clothes, shoes and accessories at the pedestrian-friendly zone. When you stroll along the streets of Myeongdong, you will notice many stores with different promotions and promoters in front of their stores who will attract guests with free samples of beauty products and immediate tax refund service. Around 4pm until nighttime, you will discover a lot of push carts line-up the streets offering variety of street foods with price ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 won. I strongly recommend travelers to visit Myeongdong at night because some shops only open in the late afternoon until 10pm.One of the most cost-effective ways to get to Myeongdong is through subway lines 2 (Euljiro 1-ga Station, Exit 5 or 6, green line) and 4 (Myeongdong Station, Exit 6, blue line).\n",
      "one of our favorite place to visit while in Seoul! its always dun in Myeongdong!\n",
      "I happened to stumble upon this area as I came out of one of the metro exits and saw lots of alleyways filled with stands for a night market. Excellent food can be found at this street market and there is a huge variety of stores to choose from if you are shopping. I highly recommend a walk through this area!\n",
      "шумно, людно и красиво. очень легко потеряться, если не знать точно, куда идете и что ищете. магазинов, конечно, тьма-тьмущая, но это в основном одни и те же магазины косметики, и в плане одежды выбора не особо много. зато от разных вкусностей глаза разбегаются, можно наесться до отвала. главное помнить, что большинство из них закрываются после 22 - я вышла в 22.30 и уже ничего не нашла.\n",
      "In the daytime, Mingdong is similar to Nanjing Road in Shanghai. It can go shopping in various stores. In the evening, when Mingdong is busiest, all kinds of snack stalls do not need to go into the stores to eat at all. They can basically walk all the way to eat and have enough.\n",
      "The old nest of sticks, Mingdong is the best place to buy cosmetics. I even bought a pile of Sinna noodles, toothpaste and chewing gum. Experienced a gambling, tasted what is called fried chicken and beer better match oh. I just didn't listen to a few words of Smitha. The usual answer is: Sawa, you Kasmida, you're gabbling. Can understand which sentence you take away?\n",
      "Interesting area with quite a number of cute places , shops , restaurants and night market . I prefer this area over Gangnam area which is to large and takes too long time to walk. Recomendable for tourists.\n",
      "some nice small street with plenty of shops and restaurants . there is a very nice Catholic Cathedral which you can see for free. you are also within walking distance of the south gate and Seoul Tower. there is also a Heretage park nearby that does not seem crowded.\n",

      "Food and entertainment street, much like Xidan Wangfujing, snacks average about 30 yuan, some traditional snacks, a street side eating and playing, stomach will be very full, snack stalls can find beautiful women and handsome men.\n",
      "Mingdong, Seoul should be the first place to shop. Female compatriots in the same trade began to get excited when they heard the name. Open cave is very big, a good day is not enough, mainly cosmetics are more popular, of course, there are clothes, jewelry and so on. Children like the long ice cream here. It's not sweet, but it's better than novelty. There is an iron shed in Mingdong, at the end of a street where money is exchanged most often in Korea.\n",
      "This is a great neighborhood! There are many great guesthouses and hotels in the area. It is close to Seoul tower and is a world class shopping district. There is a wide selection of stores and fantastic eateries.\n",
      "MyeongDong is a goodplace to visit for shopping,cheapest price also near duty free,near to the train,subway station.lots of vendors selling anything dress,bags,foods.So much enjoy and fantastic\n",
      "In the afternoon, I went to Mingdong. There were many street snacks, ranging from 2000 to 4000 won. They were delicious. In addition, cosmetics stores of all sizes, clothing, shoes and yards are all available.\n",
      "good place for sightseeing, shopping, eating.a lot of street food, shops, people.you will enjoy your trip for sure.\n",
      "This area is Soulful, even if you aren't a shopaholic, there are plenty of things to see, and an array of things to taste. You could spend hours wondering up and down the different streets and alleys.\n"
